## Instructions
To create a [**Python script**](PyBank/main.py) that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following from [**budget_data.csv**](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv):

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 
 
The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a [**text file**](PyBank/analysis/financial_analysis.txt) with the results.
